# Intro

This is the source code for bVNC, aRDP, aSPICE and Opaque, four remote desktop
clients for Android.

Please see the LICENSE file for information on how the source is licensed.

# Building

There are two ways to build the applications. With pre-built libraries, or from
scratch.

The build automation of requires Linux at the moment, due to the use of symlinks.

Building from scratch (I-b) is known to build with Android NDK r14b.

Please note that while for now there is a reference to eclipse_projects
in the directory structure of the project, you no longer have to work
in Eclipse to develop bVNC.

Pick one of I-a or I-b below, then move onto II.

## I-a With Prebuilt Libraries

Building bVNC with pre-built dependencies.

  - Set the environment variable PROJECT to one of bVNC, aSPICE, or aRDP.

        export PROJECT=bVNC
        ./eclipse_projects/download-prebuilt-dependencies.sh
        ./copy_prebuilt_files.sh $PROJECT
        ./eclipse_projects/bVNC/prepare_project.sh --skip-build $PROJECT nopath

## I-b From Scratch

Building from scratch and working in Android Studio.

  - On Linux, install Android Studio, Android SDK, and Android NDK

  - To build bVNC, aSPICE, or aRDP

    - Set the environment variable PROJECT to one of `bVNC`, `aSPICE`, or `aRDP`. For a "custom" VNC
      client, set PROJECT to a string that stars with Custom and contains Vnc, i.e. `CustomYourVncClient`
      (see III below for details).
      
    - Set the environment variables ANDROID_SDK to your SDK installation. The scripts will install the NDK automatically.

    - Example:

              export PROJECT=bVNC
              export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/your/android/NDK/
              export ANDROID_SDK=/path/to/your/android/SDK/
              export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_NDK}
              export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_SDK}/platform-tools/
              export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_SDK}/tools

    - Accept all licenses (repeat if you see an error during build)

              ${ANDROID_SDK}/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses

    - Then, run the build script which takes hours to run. E.g.:

              ./eclipse_projects/bVNC/prepare_project.sh $PROJECT $ANDROID_SDK

    - Follow the instructions that the script outputs.

## II Importing projects into Android Studio

This should be as simple as selecting "Open an existing Android Studio project" on the
Welcome screen, browsing to the remote-desktop-clients directory and selecting it.

  - One final tweak is necessary to the (external) freeRDPCore project before
    the project can build. Double-click "Gradle Scripts" on the left, and
    open build.gradle (Module freeRDPCore). Change minSdkVersion to 11.

  - Build -> Make Project should now work.

## III Building "Custom" VNC clients

It is possible to programmatically build additional customized clients based on the VNC client contained in this project
without altering any of the source code of the project.

- Place a configuration file in yaml format in `bVNC/src2/main/assets/custom_vnc_client.yaml`

- See the file `custom_vnc_client.yaml-EXAMPLE`. The numbers after each field are one of View.INVISIBLE or View.GONE
  and it controls whether the field is invisible or gone in the customized interface.

- See [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#GONE] for the numeric value of View.GONE
  and [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#INVISIBLE] for the numberic value of View.INVISIBLE.

- Place an icon at `bVNC/src2/main/res/drawable/icon_of_the_custom_app.png`.

- Edit `gradle.properties` and set CUSTOM_VNC_APP_NAME to `Name Of The Custom App` and CUSTOM_VNC_APP_ICON to `icon_of_the_custom_app`

- Follow the build procedure in I-a or I-b above, but with PROJECT set to anything that starts with `Custom` and has `Vnc` in its name.
  For instance, `CustomYourVncClient`. Your package name once the project is built will be com.iiordanov.YourVncClient.
